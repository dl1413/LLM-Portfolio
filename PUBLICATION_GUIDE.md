## ⚡ Key Differences from Original

### Jupyter Notebooks

**Before:**
```python
# In production, this would query the API
# response = self.query_gpt4(prompt)
# return json.loads(response)['bias_score']
pass
```

**After:**
```python
# Load Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer

data = load_breast_cancer()
X = pd.DataFrame(data.data, columns=data.feature_names)
y = pd.Series(data.target, name='diagnosis')

print(f"Dataset Shape: {X.shape}")
print(f"Samples: {X.shape[0]}, Features: {X.shape[1]}")
```

### README Documentation

**Before:**
```markdown
## Quick Start
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

**After:**
```markdown
## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/Breast_Cancer_Classification_PUBLICATION.ipynb
\`\`\`

### Quick Demo

\`\`\`python
import joblib
import numpy as np

# Load saved model
model = joblib.load('models/adaboost_model.pkl')
scaler = joblib.load('models/scaler.pkl')

# Make prediction
def predict_diagnosis(features):
    features_scaled = scaler.transform(features.reshape(1, -1))
    prediction = model.predict(features_scaled)[0]
    return "Benign" if prediction == 1 else "Malignant"
\`\`\`
```
