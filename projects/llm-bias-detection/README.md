# Large-Scale Content Analysis: LLM Bias Detection Study

**67,500 data points analyzed** with Bayesian hierarchical modeling and inter-rater reliability analysis.

## Overview

This project showcases advanced statistical analysis and research design skills through a large-scale content analysis study. I designed and executed a systematic framework for analyzing textbook content using multiple data sources and rigorous statistical validation.

## Key Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Observations | 67,500 |
| Inter-Rater Reliability (Krippendorff's α) | 0.84 (excellent) |
| Statistical Significance | p < 0.001 |
| Bayesian Convergence (R-hat) | < 1.01 |

## Data Analysis Highlights

- **Research Design:** Developed systematic sampling strategy for 4,500 text passages from 150 sources
- **Multi-Source Validation:** Implemented triangulation using three independent rating sources
- **Statistical Analysis:** Applied Bayesian hierarchical modeling with full uncertainty quantification
- **Reliability Analysis:** Calculated Krippendorff's alpha and pairwise correlations
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Conducted Friedman tests and post-hoc comparisons with Bonferroni correction
