# Healthcare Analytics: Breast Cancer Classification

**99.12% accuracy** diagnostic model using ensemble machine learning methods.

## Overview

This project demonstrates comprehensive data analysis skills through the development of a breast cancer diagnostic classification system. Using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset, I applied rigorous statistical methods and machine learning techniques to achieve exceptional diagnostic accuracy.

## Key Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Accuracy | 99.12% |
| Precision | 100% |
| Recall | 98.59% |
| ROC-AUC | 0.9987 |

## Data Analysis Highlights

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Analyzed 30 clinical features across 569 patient samples
- **Statistical Preprocessing:** Applied VIF analysis for multicollinearity detection, SMOTE for class balancing
- **Feature Selection:** Used Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify the most predictive features
- **Model Evaluation:** Comprehensive cross-validation with 10-fold stratified sampling
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Compared 8 different ensemble algorithms
