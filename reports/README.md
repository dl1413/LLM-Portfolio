## Reports Index

### 1. [Breast Cancer Classification Report](./Breast_Cancer_Classification_Report.md)

**Ensemble Machine Learning Methods for Breast Cancer Classification: A Comparative Study**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| ![Accuracy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Accuracy-99.12%25-brightgreen) | Test set performance |
| ![Precision](https://img.shields.io/badge/Precision-100%25-brightgreen) | Zero false positives |
| ![Recall](https://img.shields.io/badge/Recall-98.59%25-brightgreen) | Near-perfect sensitivity |
| ![CV](https://img.shields.io/badge/Cross--Validation-98.46%25-blue) | Robust generalization |

**Abstract:** Comprehensive comparison of 8 ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, Bagging, XGBoost, LightGBM, Voting, Stacking) on the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset. AdaBoost achieves best performance, exceeding human diagnostic accuracy of 90-95%.

**Key Topics:**
- Ensemble machine learning
- Medical AI/diagnostics
- Feature selection (VIF, RFE)
- Class imbalance (SMOTE)
- Cross-validation

### 2. [LLM Bias Detection Report](./LLM_Bias_Detection_Report.md)

**LLM Ensemble with Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling for Textbook Bias Detection: A Novel Framework**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| ![Alpha](https://img.shields.io/badge/Krippendorff's_α-0.84-blue) | Excellent agreement |
| ![LLMs](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLMs-3_Models-purple) | GPT-4, Claude, Llama |
| ![Passages](https://img.shields.io/badge/Passages-4,500-green) | Scalable analysis |
| ![Ratings](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ratings-67,500-orange) | Comprehensive dataset |

**Abstract:** Novel framework combining three frontier LLMs (GPT-4, Claude-3-Opus, Llama-3-70B) with Bayesian hierarchical modeling to detect and quantify bias in educational textbooks. Achieves excellent inter-rater reliability (α = 0.84) with full uncertainty quantification through PyMC.

**Key Topics:**
- Large Language Models
- Bayesian hierarchical modeling
- Inter-rater reliability
- Educational technology
- MCMC inference
