## Research Projects

### Ensemble Machine Learning for Breast Cancer Classification
*January 2026*

Developed and benchmarked eight state-of-the-art ensemble learning algorithms for binary classification of breast tumors using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset.

**Key Achievements:**
- Achieved **99.12% accuracy**, **100% precision**, and **98.59% recall** with AdaBoost classifier, exceeding human inter-observer agreement rates (85-95%)
- Implemented comprehensive preprocessing pipeline: VIF analysis for multicollinearity detection, SMOTE for class imbalance, RFE for feature selection (30 → 15 features)
- Validated model robustness with 10-fold stratified cross-validation (98.46% ± 1.12%)
- Achieved ROC-AUC of 0.9987 demonstrating near-perfect discrimination
- Implemented SHAP-based explainability for clinical interpretability and IEEE 2830-2025 compliance

**Technologies:** Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, SMOTE, SHAP, MLflow, FastAPI
